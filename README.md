# F2-NeRF

This repository has undergone significant changes from the original fork repository.

## Acknowledgment

Besides LibTorch, this project is also built upon the following awesome libraries:

- [eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for linear algebra computing
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) for I/O of YAML files
- [hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) for configuration

Some of the code snippets are inspired from [instant-ngp](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp), [torch-ngp](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp) and [ngp-pl](https://github.com/kwea123/ngp_pl).
The COLMAP processing scripts are from [multinerf](https://github.com/google-research/multinerf). The example data `ngp_fox` is from  [instant-ngp](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp).
